.RB [ \-\-lowercase ]
[options] \fIinstallers\fP ...

\fBinnoextract \-\-list\fP [options] \fIinstallers\fP ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinnoextract\fP is a tool that can extract installer executables created by Inno Setup.
.PP
\fBinnoextract\fP will extract files from installers specified on the command line.
.PP
To extract a multi-part installer with external data files, only the executable (.exe) file needs to be given as an argument to \fBinnoextract\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-color\fP[=\fIENABLE\fP]
By default
.B innoextract
will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable or disable color output accordingly. Specifically, colors will be enabled if both \fBstdout\fP and \fBstderr\fP point to a TTY and the \fBTERM\fP environment variable is not set to "\fBdumb\fP". Pass \fB1\fP or \fBtrue\fP to \fB\-\-color\fP to force color output. Pass \fB0\fP or \fBfalse\fP to never output color codes.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\fP
Don't convert Windows paths to UNIX paths and don't substitute variables in paths.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-extract\fP
Extract all files to the current directory. This action is enabled by default, unless either \fB\-\-list\fP or \fB\-\-extract\fP is specified. You may only specify one of \fB\-\-extract\fP and \fB\-\-test\fP.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-gog\fP
For some newer multi-part GOG.com installers the \fI.bin\fP files are not part of the Inno Setup installer but instead are encrypted RAR archives. This option tells innoextract to extract these files using the `unrar` or `unar` (http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline) utilities.

The \fB\-\-list\fP, \fB\-\-extract\fP and \fB\-\-output\-dir\fP options are passed along to unrar/unar, but other options may be ignored for the RAR files.
.TP
\fB\-\-gog\-game\-id\fP
Determine the ID used by GOG.com for the game contained in this installer. This will only work with Galaxy-ready GOG.com installers.

This option can be combined with \fB\-\-silent\fP to print only the game ID without additional syntax that would make consumption by other scripts harder.

The \fB\-\-gog\-game\-id\fP action can be combined with \fB\-\-list\fP, \fB\-\-test\fP and/or \fB\-\-extract\fP. If \fB\-\-gog\-game\-id\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP and \fB\-\-silent\fP are combined, the game ID (or an empty line) will be printed on it's own line before the file list.

For some newer multi-part GOG.com installers the \fI.bin\fP files are not part of the Inno Setup installer but instead are encrypted RAR archives. The password can be calculated as the MD5 checksum of the game ID:

  \fBinnoextract \-\-gog\-game\-id --silent\fP \fIsetup_....exe\fP | \fBmd5sum\fP | \fBcut \-d\fP ' ' \fB\-f\fP 1

.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Show a list of the supported options.
.TP
\fB\-\-language\fP \fILANG\fP
Extract only language-independent files and files for the given language. By default all files are extracted.
.TP
\fB\-\-license\fP
Show license information.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP
List files contained in the installer but don't extract anything.

This option can be combined with \fB\-\-silent\fP to print only the names of the contained files (one per line) without additional syntax that would make consumption by other scripts harder.

The \fB\-\-list\fP action can be combined with \fB\-\-test\fP, \fB\-\-extract\fP and/or \fB\-\-gog\-game\-id\fP to display the names of the files as they are extracted even with \fB\-\-silent\fP.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-lowercase\fP
Convert filenames stored in the installer to lower-case before extracting.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-output\-dir\fP \fIDIR\fP
Extract all files into the given directory. By default, \fBinnoextract\fP will extract all files to the current directory.

If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created. However, the parent directory must exist or extracting will fail.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-progress\fP[=\fIENABLE\fP]
By default \fBinnoextract\fP will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable or disable progress bar output accordingly. Pass \fB1\fP or \fBtrue\fP to \fB\-\-progress\fP to force progress bar output. Pass \fB0\fP or \fBfalse\fP to never show a progress bar.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Less verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-silent\fP
Don't output anything except errors and warnings unless explicitly requested.

This option can be combined with \fB\-\-list\fP to print only the names of the contained files (one per line) without additional syntax that would make consumption by other scripts harder.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-test\fP
Test archive integrity but don't write any output files. You may only specify one of \fB\-\-extract\fP and \fB\-\-test\fP.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-timestamps\fP \fITZ\fP
Inno Setup installers can contain timestamps in both UTC and 'local' timezones.

The \fB\-\-timestamps\fP option specifies what timezone should be used to adjust these 'local' file times.

Valid values are those accepted by \fBtzset\fP in the \fBTZ\fP environment variable, except with the direction of the time offset reversed: both \fB\-T CET\fP and \fB\-T GMT+1\fP will (when DST is in effect) give the same result.

Besides timezones, two special values are accepted:

  "\fBnone\fP"    Don't preserve file times for extracted files, both for UTC and 'local' timestamps. The file times wil be left the way the OS set them when creating the output files.

  "\fBlocal\fP"  Use the system timezone for 'local' timestamps. This is the normal Inno Setup behavior, and can be used together with the \fBTZ\fP environment variable.

The default value for this option is \fBUTC\fP, causing innoextract to not adjust 'local' file times. File times marked as UTC in the Inno Setup file will never be adjusted no matter what \fB\-\-timestamps\fP is set to.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Print the \fBinnoextract\fP version number and supported Inno Setup versions.

If combined with the \fB\-\-silent\fP option, only the version \fInumber\fP is printed. Otherwise, the output will contain the name (innoextract) followed by the version number on the first line, and, unless the \fB\-\-quiet\fP options is specified, the range of suuported Inno Setup installer versions on the second line.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-warn\-unused\fP
By default, innoextract will print a warning if it encounters \fI.bin\fP files that look like they could be part of the setup but are not used. This option disables that warning.
.SH EXIT VALUES
.PP
.IP \fB0\fP
Success
.IP \fB1\fP
Syntax or usage error
.IP \fB2+\fP
Broken or unsupported setup file, or input/output error
.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBinnoextract\fP currently only supports extracting all the data. There is no support for extracting individual files or components and limited support for extracting language-specific files.

Included scripts and checks are not executed.

The mapping from Inno Setup variables like the application directory to subdirectories is hard-coded.

\fBinnoextract\fP does not check if an installer includes multiple files with the same name and will continually overwrite the destination file when extracting.

Names for data slice/disk files in multi-file installers must follow the standard naming scheme.

Encrypted installers are not supported.
